      Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and
      produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
      dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent
      diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and
      partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and
      distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before
      he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. Breaking
      Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and concluded on September 29,
      2013, after five seasons consisting of 62 episodes. Among the show's
      co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter
      Jr., and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader
      and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's
      and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator
      and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus
      Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally
      ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a
      cunning business executive.

          Main article: Breaking Bad season 1 The first season was originally
          intended to be nine episodes, but due to the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild
          of America strike only seven episodes were filmed.[30] It ran from
          January 20 to March 9, 2008. Walter, diagnosed with inoperable lung
          cancer, conspires with Jesse to cook crystal meth to pay for his
          treatment and provide financial security for his family. Jesse secures
          an R.V. to cook in, while Walter devises a revolutionary formula using
          unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue.
          After a run-in with the Mexican cartel, Walter adopts the pseudonym
          "Heisenberg" and trades his "blue sky" meth with psychotic drug lord
          Tuco Salamanca. The DEA and Hank, Walt's brother-in-law, become aware
          of Heisenberg's presence in the drug trade and begin investigating.

          Tuco and Walter become hostile and Tuco is killed by Hank. After a
          failed attempt by Walter and Jesse to start their own distribution
          network leaves one of their dealers arrested and one murdered, Walter
          hires corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman, who later connects them to
          high-profile drug distributor Gus Fring and hitman Mike Ehrmantraut.
          Jesse dates his apartment manager Jane, who introduces him to heroin,
          making him unreliable. After selling a shipment to Gus, Walt refuses
          to pay Jesse his half of the money, but Jane blackmails him. Walt
          returns to Jesse to apologize but instead finds him and Jane passed
          out on heroin, following Walter allowing an unconscious Jane to choke
          on her own vomit. Jesse wakes up the next morning, traumatized, enters
          rehab. Walt seems content until he witnesses a mid-air collision of
          two planes; a result of Jane's father, an air-traffic controller,
          becoming distraught over her death while working.
