      <h5>Description</h5>
      Agnyaathavaasi (lit.â€‰' person in exile') is a 2018 Indian Telugu-language
      action drama film[3][4] written and directed by Trivikram Srinivas. The
      film stars Pawan Kalyan, Aadhi Pinisetty, Keerthy Suresh and Anu Emmanuel
      in lead roles. The film began its principal photography in April 2017
      which ended in November 2017. Anirudh Ravichander composed the film's
      score and soundtrack. Upon release on 10 January 2018, during the
      Sankranti festival weekend, it received mixed-to-negative reviews from
      both critics and audiences, alike. The performances of the cast,
      dialogues, production values, cinematography, songs, background score, and
      action sequences received praise. However, the direction, writing,
      screenplay, pace were criticized.[5] The film, released under big
      expectations, could not manage to make an impact at the box office and was
      a box office disaster, recovering less than half of its investment.[6] The
      film was dubbed in Malayalam as Yuvarajavu and later it was dubbed in
      Hindi as Yevadu 3.
