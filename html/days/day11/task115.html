      Oy! is a 2009 Indian Telugu-language romantic drama film written and
      directed by debutanat Anand Ranga. The film stars Siddharth and Shamili
      (in her first leading role),[1] while Sunil and Ali play supporting roles.
      The music of the film was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja.[2] The story
      revolves around Uday (Siddharth) fulfilling the wishes of Sandhya
      (Shamili) during her last days, as the latter was diagnosed with cancer.
      The film was released on 3 July 2009. The film is loosely based on the
      2002 film A Walk to Remember. The film was dubbed in Tamil as Kadhal
      Alai.[3] Though the film didn't do well at the box office during its
      initial release, it gained a strong cult following over the years and has
      remained as a favorite of many. It has been re-released on valentine's day
      of 2024, many people collectively praised the film for not just songs but
      also for the storyline.
